<h1>MRZ Reader</h1>

This project uses Tesseract and OpenSvSharp to process images and extract MRZ in a passport.
It can be used for diffrent endgoals. In its core it's a simple OCR that can extract data from a image.

Feel free to use it however you like.

Depending on what kind of language you want to use you have to download diffrent .testeddata. These are easy to find.
